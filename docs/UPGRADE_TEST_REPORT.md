# Graft upgrade test report

## Initial checks

- `npm run typecheck`: passed before implementation changes.
- `npm run lint`: passed before implementation changes.
- First restricted `npm test`: no tests executed; Vite worker realpath calls
  were denied with EPERM. Retrying with the authorized unrestricted test runner.
- The previous verified 0.6.14 baseline had 939 unit tests and 45 desktop tests
  passing, with skipped cases recorded in `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`.

## Implementation validation so far

| Command / check | Actual result |
| --- | --- |
| New truncated-stream regression fixtures before changes | 5 failed, establishing the unsafe completion mechanism. |
| Partial-thinking recovery fixtures before changes | 2 failed; already-visible thinking disappeared on failed/cancelled streams. |
| `npx vitest run tests/unit/providers.test.ts tests/unit/agent.test.ts tests/unit/renderer/sessionsStore.test.ts` | 154 passed after changes. |
| Motion unit tests | 6 passed, including visibility timer disposal/resume. |
| Transcript projection / response quality / performance tests | 9 passed, including parity through rewind and live tool results. |
| Workspace layout and draft unit tests | 10 passed. |
| First full implementation unit run | 978 passed, 28 skipped; one LSP cleanup failure (Windows EPERM). |
| LSP shutdown regression | Real owned descendant remained alive after forced disposal before fix; active and evicted client regressions pass after fix. 8 LSP tests pass; cancellation/isolation repeated independently 3 times. |
| Final complete unit suite | 982 passed, 28 skipped; 79 files passed, 2 skipped. No cleanup retries weakened. |
| Scoped desktop confirmation | All 6 cases passed across scoped runs. New fixture assumptions and async clipboard checks corrected; original workspace coverage retained. |
| Final typecheck / lint | Passed, including node, renderer and E2E TypeScript. |
| Final complete desktop suite | 48 passed, 5 skipped (4.3 minutes). All original artifact/attachment/schedule and writer tests retained and passed. |
| Production build | Passed for 0.6.15. Known Monaco large-chunk warning remains. |
| Windows packaging | Completed; 0.6.15 NSIS installer and unpacked executable created. |
| Unpacked executable smoke tests | 2 passed: package contents and actual native tool/editor/LSP/terminal workflow. |
| Installation | NSIS exited 0; installed executable reports 0.6.15. |
| Installed executable smoke tests | 2 passed using isolated profiles; same native workflow and version verification. |
| Original profile preservation | Schema 7; 12 sessions and 3 providers; zero missing backed-up IDs; SQLite quick_check `ok`. |

The benchmark command uses `--disableConsoleIntercept` to capture real measurements:
500 turns, 120 live updates, full projection 38.37 ms versus cached projection
0.88 ms. This measures the production projection functions, not an app-wide speedup.

No private provider endpoint generation quality or cross-platform result is claimed.

The default desktop skips are the two packaged cases (run separately against the
real executable) and three opt-in README screenshot cases. Unit skips include
opt-in live MCP/container integrations and platform-dependent fixtures. No skipped
case is reported as passed. macOS/Linux builds and live paid provider requests were
not run. The full master brief, universal shell/MCP isolation, indexing, best-of-N
and durable execution replay remain incomplete.

Installer: `dist/Graft-Setup-0.6.15.exe`, 123,782,941 bytes, unsigned.
SHA-256: `0D754F847CF6B437A8E7E42D04EAACF7FB65A75812346B726CF21A1F854ADC75`.
Unpacked app: `dist/win-unpacked/Graft.exe`. Installed app:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%/Programs/Graft/Graft.exe`. Private profile backup remains ignored
under `dist/upgrade-backup-0.6.14-20261009`; it must not be published.

This is a verified local Windows upgrade, not completion of the larger brief or
a signed, cross-platform public release. The previous GitHub CI run
`38001350984` could not start steps because account billing was locked.
